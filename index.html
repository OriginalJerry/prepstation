                <p>SAT importance</p>
                <h2>The SAT</h2>
              </header>
              <p>The first and most vital reason for the sat being important is that it’s a must for college applications. The scores on the SAT and ACT allow them to narrow down the playing field and make decisions on acceptance.</p>
              <p>The second reason is that it allows for you to qualify for scholarships. Your SAT score can be used to apply for scholarships. These are sometimes merit based scholarships, granted directly from your choice of college during
                the application process.</p>
              <p>The last reason is that it goes beyond GPA. Your SAT score offers you another opportunity to show the college or university how far you’ve come academically, even if your GPA is a little lower than expect or want.

                <p>Why the AP test is important</p>
                <h2>AP Tests</h2>
              </header>
              <p>The AP test is an optional test a student can take at the end of the year. It varies to many tests such from an AP Language to AP Physics C. The AP test is also used as a means of assessing how much you learned in the class
                and whether your experience merits college credit.</p>
              <p>Essentially, AP Tests are a standardized way of validating your course record. They’re a measure used to control for poorly taught AP classes where students earn As but don’t actually know the material. Although AP curriculum
                is supposed to be consistent at every school, teachers have a lot of freedom in how they teach the subject and grade the class. </p>
              <p>You can earn college credits for high AP Test scores at most schools, and your scores may also help you to place out of introductory classes. Doing well on AP tests can mean finishing college early or avoiding college classes
                in subjects that are repetitive for you.</p>
